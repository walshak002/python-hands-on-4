# Python Dictionary Tasks - Intermediate Hands-On 4

## Overview

This collection contains **5 hands-on Python tasks** designed for **intermediate learners** focusing on **Python dictionaries** with occasional use of **lists and tuples**.
Each task presents a **real-life scenario**, often inspired by **daily activities in Jos, Nigeria**, to help learners **apply dictionary operations logically**.

These tasks **emphasize dictionary manipulations** including:

* `copy()`
* `update()`
* `pop()`
* `popitem()`
* `clear()`

Some tasks also introduce **nested dictionaries** and **tuples** to simulate **real-world immutable data**.

---

## How to Use

Clone the project using:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Cohort-III-web2-Beginners/python-hands-on-4.git
```

Then:

```bash
cd python-hands-on-4/
```

Remove the original `.git` folder to create your own repo:

```bash
rm -rf .git/
```

Afterwards, create your **own remote repository** and push your code.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing these tasks, you will:

* **Understand Python dictionaries** and their real-world applications
* Learn **copying vs shared references** in mutable objects
* Practice **dictionary methods** like `copy()`, `update()`, `pop()`, `popitem()`, and `clear()`
* Work with **nested dictionaries** to organize complex data
* Understand when and why to use **tuples for immutable data**
* Develop **problem-solving skills** through **real-life scenarios**

---

## Task Structure

* Each task is presented as a **docstring** (`""" Task Description """`)
* Tasks **describe real-world scenarios** to improve **logical thinking**
* Each scenario naturally leads to **dictionary operations** without explicitly instructing which method to use
* Some tasks involve **lists and tuples** to enrich your understanding of combined data structures

---

## Prerequisites

* Basic understanding of **Python syntax**
* Familiarity with **variables, lists, and tuples**
* Comfort with **dictionary basics** like key-value pairs

---

## What's NOT Included

* Loops (`for`, `while`)
* Conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
* Functions (except for structuring your code if you choose)
* Advanced data structures (sets, classes, etc.)

---

## How to Approach the Tasks

1. Read each task’s docstring carefully.
2. Visualize the **real-life scenario** and determine which **dictionary operations** to apply.
3. Solve the task **step by step**, modifying the dictionary as required.
4. Take a snapshot of your work if needed (especially before clearing a dictionary).
5. Test your results by printing outputs to verify your logic.

---

## Target Audience

* Python beginners **transitioning to intermediate**
* Students learning **data structures and dictionary operations**
* Coding bootcamp participants or self-taught programmers
* Anyone seeking to **improve logical thinking** with **real-life problem simulations**

---

## Pro Tips

* **Think in real life:** “What happens if I remove this item from the cart?”
* **Experiment with references:** Understand why some changes affect multiple variables.
* **Keep it clean:** Use dictionary methods instead of manually rewriting values.
* **Work without loops:** Focus purely on **dictionary manipulations**.
